    "**How the Enigma Machine Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Enigma Machine uses a combination of rotors, a plugboard, and a reflector to encrypt messages.\n",
    "Each letter is passed through a series of components, each modifying the letter based on its current settings. The machine’s complexity arises from the numerous possible configurations, which greatly enhances security.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t1.\tRotors: Each rotor contains a wiring configuration that shifts the input letter based on its position. The machine typically uses three rotors, which can be selected by the user.\n",
    "\t2.\tPlugboard: Before a letter is processed by the rotors, it passes through a plugboard where pairs of letters are swapped.\n",
    "\t3.\tReflector: After passing through the rotors, the signal is reflected back through the rotors, effectively doubling the encryption.\n",
    "\t4.\tRotor Notches: These are specific positions on the rotors that trigger the movement of adjacent rotors, simulating a stepping mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project Structure**\n",
